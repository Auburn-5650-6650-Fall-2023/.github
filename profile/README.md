## Welcome! 👋

This Github organization website is for the course **Math 5650/6650** at Auburn University of  ``Fall 2023``. 

The course will emphasize both theories and implementation of the common optimization methods. The theory part follows the textbook :closed_book: ``Numerical Optimization`` by Jorge Nocedal and Stephen Wright. We probably will not cover the ``linear programming`` due to the limitation on course hours.  



### Prerequisite: 

- :heavy_check_mark: Linear Differential Equations (2650)
- :heavy_check_mark: Topics in Linear Algebra (2660)


### Bi-weekly submissions: 

- Basic theory problems
- Coding projects

### Final Group Projects (4 weeks):

- TBA
