# Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This website is for the course **Math 5650/6650** at Auburn University of **Fall 2023**. 

The course will emphasize both theories and implementation of the common optimization methods. The theory part follows the textbooks

- :closed_book: ``Numerical Optimization`` by Jorge Nocedal and Stephen Wright. We probably will not cover the ``linear programming`` due to the limitation on course hours.  
- :closed_book: ``Convex Optimization`` by by Lieven Vandenberghe and Stephen P. Boyd. You may download the book from https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/bv_cvxbook.pdf. We may use this book for references. 

## Prerequisite: 

- :heavy_check_mark: Linear Differential Equations (2650)
- :heavy_check_mark: Topics in Linear Algebra (2660)
- :heavy_check_mark: Any programming language for computing. ``Python``, ``Matlab``, ``Julia`` are highly preferred.
